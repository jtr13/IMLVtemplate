Then as needed override one or more defaults in particular chunks: {r, fig.width=8, fig.height=6} In general, faceted plots should have larger sizes. Examples: 6.5 Figure numbers Include a chunk label and a figure caption fig.cap in the chunk options: {r hist1, fig.cap = &quot;Histogram of `Sepal.Width`&quot;} Refer to the plot with the chunk label: Figure \\(\\text{\\@ref(fig:hist1)}\\) showsâ€¦ Figure 6.1: Histogram of Sepal.Width Figure 6.1 shows the distribution of Sepal.Width in the iris dataset. 6.6 Resources (More will be added) Rmarkdown for Scientists "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
